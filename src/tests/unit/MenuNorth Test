/**
*This document is sectioned into:
	Testing the basic layout
	Testing the submenu "File" function
	Testing the menu item "Save" function and saving a screenshot of the window
*/

//Basic layout
-- This is located at the top of the window.
-- Should have one submenu at the left named "File"

//Testing submenu "File"
-- When clicked on, a menu pops up, which has a menu item named "Save"
-- When the user clicks on something other than "File" then the submenu closes

//Testing menu Item "Save"
-- When clicked on, a save dialog opens up. 
-- When the user presses "CTRL + S" on the keys, this item is activated.
	So the save dialog opens up.
-- The user picks the file directory and saves a file. A png should be formed.
	The png file would be a screenshot of the window the instance the user saved it.
