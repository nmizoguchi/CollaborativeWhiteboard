--MenuWest is found on the left side of the display.
--MenuNorth is found at the top of the display.
--MenuEast is found at the right of the display.
--a canvas is found in the center of the display.

//Multiple users
-- If two users are looking at the same board and draw things that overlap,
	the overlapping patterns should look the same for each user
-- If a user is editing the board, their username shows next to their cursor as they edit

//Disconnecting
-- The user disconnects and application stops running when the user closes the window
