//Basic layout from top to bottom
-- Does not change width and the elements change heights proportionally until they reach a minimal height.
-- There is a list of current usernames under "Online Users".
-- Underneath the Online users list, there is a list of board names under "Available Boards"
-- Then there is a button named "New Board"
-- Underneath there is a message box.
-- Last, there is a "Chat Here: " followed by a text box.

//Online Users list
-- Should update when a user enters the server, by adding the new username to the end of the list.
-- Should also update when a user disconnects, by removing the username and moving the rest 
	of the list such that there is no gap (if the username was not at the end of the list).

//Available Boards list
-- Should update when a new board is created by adding a the new board name to the end of the list.
-- When the user selects one of the items on the list, the user's canvas would display the board which they had selected.

//New Board button test
-- When clicked on, a dialog would open up asking the users to enter a board name
-- If the user clicks cancel, the dialog would close and nothing would happen.
-- If the user does not enter a name and clicks OK, the dialog would close and nothing would happen
-- If the user does enter a name and clicks OK, the Available Boards list would update
	and the user's current canvas would display the new board (switching from the previous one).

//Message box test
-- When a user enters the server, the message box would add a new line "[new username] has entered the server"
-- When a user disconnects from the server, the message box would add a new line "[disconnected username] has disconnected from the server"
-- When a user enters a message the box would add a line "[chatting username] [message]"

//Chat Here text box
-- When a user enters a message in the text box, the message box would be updated accordingly
	and the text box would be cleared.
