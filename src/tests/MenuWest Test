//Tests for MenuWest

/**
* This document is sectioned into:
	Testing the basic layout
	Testing the tools (eraser, freehand, draw line, rectangle)
	Testing the size-related components
	Testing the color-related buttons
*/

	//basic layout
-- From top to bottom there are tool buttons in the following order:
	Eraser, Freehand, Draw Line, Rectangle
	This is then followed by a JLabel "Size: " adjacent to an input box.
	This input box should also display the current brush size.
	Beneath this, there is a + and - button that should increment/decrement the size by 1.
	Then there are two colored buttons adjacent to each other.
-- If the user changes the window size, this portion of the window should not change widths but does change heights.
	The objects (aside from the size text box) individually does not change size however.
	
	//Tool button functions	
--	Tests if only one of the test buttons are selected at a time
	by clicking one of the buttons (like the Eraser tool button), 
	then another button (like the Rectangle tool button).
//Eraser Tool
--  When the eraser button (has the icon of an eraser) is selected, a brush in a white color of the current brush size
	would be activated and the user could use this to cover up any drawings 
	already on the canvas with white (essentially "erasing" it).
//Freehand tool
--	When the freehand tool (has the icon of a pencil) is selected, a brush in the current brush color of the current brush size
	would be activated and the user uses this to draw what they wish on the canvas.
//Draw Line tool
-- 	When the draw line tool (has the icon of a straight line) is selected, the user can then draw a line with thickness of the brush size 
	and of the current color. This is done by clicking and dragging across the canvas, then releasing the mouse button.
	In the case of the user just clicking, then there will be a very short line that occurs on that point.            
	To check if the line can be drawn at any angle, click and drag the mouse around in a circle.
	To check for thread safety and concurrency, as you draw the line have another user erase across it. 
	This should not affect the line in the drawing process. Also, have two users draw lines of different colors that intersect each other.
	The intersecting lines should overlap the same way on both screens.
//Rectangle tool
-- 	The rectangle tool (indicated by a rectangle icon) is selected, the user is then able to draw a rectangle
	by clicking and dragging. The point where the user clicked at would be the starting corner and the 
	point where the user released the mouse button would be the opposing corner of the rectangle.
	The border color would be determined by the user-selected color (default black) chosen using the left color button.
	The border size would be the current brush size. The fill color (default none) would be
	determined by the user-selected color using the right color button.
	Check if the rectangle can be drawn in any quadrant relative to the starting corner.
	Check for thread-safety and concurrency by having another user draw lines or erase while one user is drawing a rectangle.
	
//Testing Size options
--	Every time the brush size is changed, the text box that displays a number, should be updated and displays the current size.
	A user can change the size by entering a number in the text box and pressing ENTER.
--	Clicking the - button should decrement the size by 1. Clicking the + button should decrement the size by 1.


//Testing Color options
--	The left button color determines the freehand and draw line's color and the rectangle border's color.
	(Default black). When clicked on, a color palette would pop up. When a user selects a color and presses OK,
	the palette would close and the button would be turned to that color.
--	The right button color determines the rectangle fill color. When the user clicks it with 
	the left mouse button, the color button would switch between "on" or "off". The "on" mode
	would mean that the rectangle has a fill color, which is the user-selected color. (Default black).
	The user would know it is "on" if the button is the color of the user-selected color.
	The "off" mode would mean that the rectangle does not have a fill color. This is indicated by 
	the button turning into a sort of dull, light blue color.
	When the user clicks on the color button with the right mouse button, a color palette pops up. 
	After the user selects a color, the button (if it in "on" mode or the next time it is "on") will then change colors.

//Multiple users
	//Selecting buttons
--	This is all specific for each user. Meaning, if User A selects Eraser and B selects Draw Line,
then the buttons selected would be Eraser for A, and Draw Line for B.
	//Changing size
-- 	If the brush size for both users A and B is 50 and A enters 26 in the text box, A's brush size would be 26 while at the same time B clicked the + button, B's brush size would be 51.
	//Selecting colors
--	User A selects a color (either left or right), and User B would not be affected by this. The same goes for both users selecting a color simultaneously.
	And the same goes for the different users selecting colors on different color buttons.
